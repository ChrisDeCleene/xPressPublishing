## General Information
- Project created as part of the Full Stack Engineer Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)
- Created using NodeJS and Express JS
- Database created using NodeJS Sqlite3 package
- Focus of the project is using the CRUD model to interact with sql database.

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Create artists, series and issues on a sqlite database using NodeJS Sqlite3
- Update artists, series and issues from the sqlite database using NodeJS Sqlite3
- Read artists, series and issues from the sqlite database regarding each sqlite table
- Delete artists, issues or series from  the sqlite database


## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Once you have the project downloaded, you'll need to run some terminal commands to get the application started. First, open the root project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project and build the front-end application. Once it has finished installing, you can run `npm run start` to begin your server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal. The `npm run start` script will automatically restart your server whenever you make changes to the **server.js** file or **server/** folder. If you want to turn this off, simply start your server with the `node server.js` command. You can kill either process with the `Ctrl + C` command.

### `npm run test`

You will see a list of tests that ran with information
about whether or not each test passed. After this list, you will see more specific output
about why each failing test failed. While they are open in a terminal window, these tests will re-run every time you save server files. If you want to quit the testing loop, use `Ctrl + C`. If you only want to run the tests once, you can run the `mocha` command in the terminal from your project root directory.


## Usage
To see the application in its working state, simply open **index.html** in a web browser while the server is running on your terminal [see above for more details](#setup). You should use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) (at least version 60) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (at least version 55). The links above will let you download the latest release of either browser if you do not have it or are unsure of which version you're running.
